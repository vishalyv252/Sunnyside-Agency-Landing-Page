# Sunnyside-Agency-Landing-Page

Hello guys, I created "Sunnyside agency landing page" using React and Tailwind. 

->Tailwind:
In Tailwind, I applied the layout for the webpage using "flex".

->ReactJS:
In ReactJS, React allows JSX (JavaScript XML), where JSX is a syntax extension used in ReactJS to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. I applied 'useState' hook for toogling the mobile navbar. I created the navbar using react router. I applied 'useLocation' from react router for styling active links.
