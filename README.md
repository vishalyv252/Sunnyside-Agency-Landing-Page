# Sunnyside-Agency-Landing-Page

Hello guys, I created the "Sunnyside agency landing page" using React and Tailwind. 

->Tailwind:
In Tailwind, I applied the layout for the webpage using "flex". I styled the navbar using "flex".

->ReactJS:
In ReactJS, React allows 'JSX' (JSX - JavaScript XML), where JSX is a syntax extension used in ReactJS to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. I applied the 'useState' hook for toggling the mobile navbar. I created the navbar using React router. I applied 'useLocation' from react-router for styling active links. I used react-router as the latest version.

->Optional:
In the About, Services and Projects pages, I created a dummy 404 for these pages as an optional one.
